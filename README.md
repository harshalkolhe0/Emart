# E-Mart

## Introduction

This is an android project. This project is built to reduce the gap between retailers and its customers. This app contains two login pages one for retailers another for its customers. Retailer uploads its menu list at the time of creating an account afterwards retailer can add more items based on his requirement later. Retailer gets notification when the order is placed.
 
The customer picks a shop and selects items from the menu and adds it to the cart and then proceeds to pay.
